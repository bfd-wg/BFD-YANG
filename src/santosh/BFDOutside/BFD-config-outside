                 When a BFD entry is created, a server MAY initialize
                 the type leaf with a valid value, e.g., if it is 
                 possible to derive the type from the name of the BFD
                 session.

                 If a client tries to set the type of an BFD session to a
                 value that can never be used by the system, e.g., if the
                 type is not supported or if the type does not match the
                 name of the BFD session, the server MUST reject the request.
                 A NETCONF server MUST reply with an rpc-error with the
                 error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.";
